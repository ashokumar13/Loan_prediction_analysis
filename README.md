# Loan Prediction Analysis - Classification

This project focuses on predicting loan approval status using machine learning classification algorithms. It is aimed at helping financial institutions automate and enhance their decision-making process by analyzing historical loan application data.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Loan approval is a crucial task for banks, involving assessment of various applicant attributes like income, credit history, dependents, etc. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a loan should be approved or not, based on applicant data.

## ✅ Objectives

* Clean and preprocess the dataset.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* Apply different classification algorithms.
* Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (for data visualization)
* **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning models)

## 📁 Project Structure

* `Loan Prediction Analysis - Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with complete end-to-end workflow, from data cleaning to model evaluation.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy
* Confusion Matrix
* Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

## 📌 Key Features

* End-to-end classification workflow
* Visual insights through EDA
* Comparison of multiple ML algorithms
* Clear performance metrics for evaluation

## 📦 Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes attributes such as:

* Gender, Married, Education, ApplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Credit\_History, etc.

> *Note: The dataset is assumed to be similar to the Loan Prediction datasets commonly found on platforms like Kaggle.*
